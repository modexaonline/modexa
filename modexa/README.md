# Modexa v4 — White · Black · Green (React + Supabase)

Public website + secure admin studio. Frontend: React/Vite. Backend: Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage).

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173  (admin: /admin)
```
`.env` already contains the Supabase URL + publishable key of project `modexa`. **Set `SITE_URL` to your real domain** (already set to `https://modexa.online`).

## Deploy (Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages)
- Build command: `npm run build`   Output: `dist`
- Environment variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, **`SITE_URL`**
- `npm run build` = `vite build` + `scripts/prerender.mjs`. The prerender step writes a real HTML file for every important page (title, meta, canonical, JSON-LD, readable text) and generates `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` and `llms.txt`. It also pulls your published mods, guides and custom pages from Supabase. **Re-deploy after publishing new content** (or add a Supabase webhook → deploy hook) so new pages get their own static HTML + sitemap entry.

## New in v6
- **Site structure:** Apps · Games · Guide · Blog (Categories / Trending / Latest pages removed; old URLs 301-redirect to /apps). App and Game listings are the same type of page with the same features; Posts are either *Blog* or *Guide*.
- **Blogger-style editor** (Posts, App listings, Game listings, page sections): **Compose** and **HTML** views, find & replace, undo/redo, headings, align, lists, quote, links, **images from link or upload from device**, **buttons** (13 templates, or your own button image, or a plain blue text link), custom code blocks, ad blocks. Ads and scripts show as labelled blocks in Compose — never as `[ad:…]` text. Raw `<script>` pasted into HTML becomes a *CODE* block automatically.
- **Auto-clean:** pasted text (plain, Word, Docs, ChatGPT…) is turned into headings, sub-headings and paragraphs without changing a single word. Also the **Auto-format** button.
- **Download buttons:** every button (and the listing’s Download button) opens a countdown screen (default 30 s, per button or in Site & brand) with a “Download wait screen” ad slot, then redirects automatically.
- **Smart search:** header, home, Apps/Games and the search page suggest matches across apps, games, guides and blog posts as you type; one matching word is enough, typos are tolerated, and results narrow to the exact page as the spelling completes.
- **Ads engine:** *Auto* render mode (real same-site frame first, then automatically runs on the page if the network shows nothing), `document.write` ad tags supported everywhere, `?adsdebug=1` diagnostics. **Site & brand → Ads:** load ads *after cookie accept* or *always*.
- **Website editor:** all pages are listed with Edit / Reset, **Delete** for custom pages, and a **WordPress-style page builder** (Hero, Text, Image, Buttons, Columns, Cards, FAQ, Latest apps/games/posts, CTA, Custom code, Ad slot, Divider, Spacer — add, reorder, duplicate, delete).
- **Site & brand:** announcement position (top / below header / bottom), unlimited social links with built-in or **uploaded icons**, download countdown default.
- Removed all notice boxes (demo/verification/source/safety notes), footer disclaimer, trust strip and hero claims.

SQL for v6: `supabase/v6_listings_guides_builder.sql` (already applied to project `modexa`).

## v5 — Ads, Website editor (earlier)
All of this lives in **Admin** (sidebar):
- **Ads manager** — add banners (every standard size: 300×250, 728×90, 320×50, 970×250, 300×600, 160×600, responsive, custom…), native/script ads, pop-under and social-bar scripts, custom HTML (AdSense etc.) and **direct links** (button / card / text). Pick the placement once and it runs on every matching blog automatically: top of article, inside content (after paragraph N, optionally repeated), end of article, mod pages, home, sticky footer bar, or site-wide scripts. Target all blogs, selected posts or selected games; exclude posts; desktop-only or mobile-only. Use `[ad:shortcode]` inside a post for an exact spot. Banners render in a sandboxed iframe (cannot read your site data); switch a unit to *Inline* for AdSense-style code.
- **Blog editor toolbar** — headings, bold, links, images, **Direct link button** (`[btn:Label](https://…)`, rel=sponsored) and an **Insert ad** dropdown. Each post has a *Game* selector and a *Show ads on this post* switch.
- **Consent** — with “Load ads only after the visitor accepts cookies” ON (default), nothing loads until *Accept all*; Privacy and Cookie policies automatically gain an Advertising section while ads are enabled.
- **Games** — controls the home page “Browse by game” container. Clicking a game opens its chosen blog (or its newest linked guide); if it has none it opens the game hub page.
- **Website editor** — edit text, SEO title/description, quick-answer box, sections, FAQs of **every page** (About, Contact, Privacy, Terms, Cookies, Copyright, Guidelines, FAQ, Mods, Games, Categories, Trending, Latest, Blog, Submit…), the **Home page** (hero, section headings, steps, cards, CTA) and the **header/footer menus**. “Reset to default” restores the built-in text.
- **Site & brand** — name, logo, default share image, footer text, social links, announcement bar, ads master switches.

**Ad not showing? (blank banner / no pop-under)** Open any page with `?adsdebug=1` (e.g. `https://modexa.online/?adsdebug=1`). A panel shows whether the master switch is ON, whether the visitor accepted cookies, whether an ad blocker is active, which ads were loaded, and — per slot — whether the network actually returned content. Render modes: **Frame** (default; real same-site frame, works with Adsterra/Monetag/Propeller/ExoClick-style `document.write` code), **Inline** (AdSense/loader scripts), **Strict** (sandboxed; many networks stay blank). Real ads can still be blank until the network approves your domain, when there is no ad to serve, or with an ad blocker; pop-unders fire only after a click and are limited to once per visitor per day.

Database: `supabase/v5_ads_games_cms.sql` (already applied to project `modexa`).

## Supabase
Schema (`supabase/schema.sql`) is already applied to project `modexa`. Admin login: username `admin` (maps to `admin@modexa.local`). Change the password in Supabase → Authentication → Users and keep public sign-ups OFF.

## SEO · AEO · GEO — what is built in
| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **SEO** | Unique title + meta description per page, canonical URLs, OpenGraph/Twitter cards, single H1 per page, semantic headings, breadcrumbs (visual + `BreadcrumbList`), sitemap, robots, noindex on search/saved/404, fast self-hosted fonts, code-split routes. |
| **AEO** (answer engines, featured snippets, voice) | Every page opens with an answer-first “Quick answer” box, question-style headings and FAQ accordions with `FAQPage` schema; mods get `SoftwareApplication` + `HowTo` schema; guides get `Article`. |
| **GEO** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini…) | Prerendered HTML so AI crawlers that do not run JavaScript still read full content; `llms.txt` site summary; `robots.txt` explicitly allows GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ChatGPT-User, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended; clear entity info (Organization/WebSite schema, About page, last-updated dates, creator attribution). |

Content lives in `src/content/` (`legal.js` = About, Contact, Privacy, Terms, Cookies, Copyright/DMCA, Guidelines, FAQ; `seo.js` = listing pages + home). Edit text there. Prefer not to touch code? Use **Admin → Website editor** (it overrides the built-in text; “Custom pages” is for brand-new pages).

## Legal pages — please review
The policy pages describe how this site actually works today (no accounts, no tracking cookies, Supabase + hosting providers as processors, forms for contact/submissions). They are solid starting templates, **not legal advice**. Before launch: confirm governing law/jurisdiction wording, add your business/contact details, and update the Privacy and Cookie policies if you add analytics, ads or newsletters (and then add a consent choice).

## Theme
White background, black text/UI, green accent. Tokens are at the top of `src/theme.css` (`--green-700`, `--black`, …).

## Vercel deploy: Supabase connection

Vercel does not upload your local `.env` file. This project now ships `src/lib/publicConfig.js` with the
Supabase URL and **publishable** key, so the admin login works even if you set nothing in Vercel.
(The publishable key is meant to be public. Security comes from Row Level Security. Never paste a
`secret` or `service_role` key into any file in this project.)

To override from Vercel instead: Project > Settings > Environment Variables, add
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `SITE_URL` (your real domain), then redeploy.
Variables set there take priority over `publicConfig.js`.
